#### Summary 
  This project focuses on analyzing UK train journey data to extract valuable insights into operational performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends. The analysis was conducted by creating a data pipeline in Snowflake, a powerful cloud-based data platform, and leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization tools. The findings aim to provide actionable recommendations for train operators to improve service delivery, increase customer satisfaction, and optimize revenu

####  Business Statement

The train industry in the UK faces ongoing challenges, including delays, evolving customer preferences, and optimizing revenue streams across routes. By analyzing the provided dataset, this project seeks to solve key business challenges by uncovering patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

1. By analyzing this dataset, the project aims to address the following key business objectives:
2. Improve punctuality and minimize delays by identifying common delay reasons.
3. Enhance revenue generation by identifying profitable routes and payment trends.
4. Understand customer behavior to improve ticketing services and customer experience.
5. Optimize route and schedule planning to match demand patterns

#### Project scope
This project utilizes a data engineer pipeline to manage and analyze the UK train dataset. It incorporates a Snowflake-powered data pipeline to streamline the data preparation, processing, and analysis stages. The ultimate goal is to identify improvement opportunities in service reliability, revenue growth, and customer satisfaction

### Tools used
Snowflake:
Snowflake was the primary tool for building the data  pipeline, including data ingestion, transformation, and aggregation.
What it was used for:
1. SnowSQL: Used to load the dataset into Snowflake and execute SQL queries for data manipulation and exploration.
2. Tasks and Streams: Automated data processing by scheduling tasks and capturing changes to datasets in near-real-time.
3. Stored Procedures: Implemented to execute complex transformations and aggregations, simplifying data workflows.
4. snowflake dashboard:Implemented  visualiztion
5. 
#### Project Workflow
The project followed a structured workflow to ensure accuracy and efficiency:

1.  Data Loading: The dataset was ingested into Snowflake using SnowSQL, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
2.  Data Pipeline Creation :Streams captured incremental data changes for real-time updates.
3.  Tasks automated the execution of transformations at scheduled intervals.
4. Stored Procedures  Stored Procedures handled complex calculations such as revenue aggregation by route and customer segmentation.
5.  Data Transformation:Transformations were performed directly in Snowflake to calculate KPIs such as
   * What is the average ticket price across different routes or destinations
   * count the number of trip made by the train from the arrival to destination
   * price of ticket by date of purchase
   * On-time performance percentage.
   * Average delay time per route.
   * Revenue trends by ticket type and payment method.


#### Revenue Analysis
1. **[Revenue Generated by Route](SQL/revenue_analysis.sql)**: Calculates the average ticket price for each route.
2. **[Revenue Generated by Payment Method](SQL/revenue_ananlysis2.sq)**: Calculates the average ticket price based on payment methods.
